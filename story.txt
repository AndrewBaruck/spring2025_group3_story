One day, I was driving 100 kmh over the speed limit in my Porsche. I really wanted to get brot from the bakery. But it was hot and the Klimaanlage in my Porsche wasn't blowing cold. So, I decided it was time to head over to the Biergarten to drink a cool one and relax. After kicking back with a cold one, I began to develop a craving for some Apfelkuchen. All of a sudden, a wild Mehlhase scurried towards my feet, so I began running! I ran for hours upon hours upon days until my lederhose dissolved. Then I saw a BMW that I can use to drive back to the beer garden. But, having been at the biergarten I got lost and ended up at a big Hauptstrasse. After a long day, the only thing left to do was head over to the Flughafen for some wettbewerbsfaehig flying. While doing some wettbewerbsfaehig flying, I decided to schloss in and skydive into the Biergarten to pet the Hund. Just when I thought I had seen everything, a Doener Hund fell on my head!
